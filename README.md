# React-start

React project starter with ease

## Motivation

Most of the time, [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) will do the work for scaffolding a react project for you.
I wanted to learn how to create a full react ready project, and it turned out to be useful.

## What I Used

### Tools
- Bundling with [webpack](http://webpack.js.org/)
- ES-Next with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- Styling with [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Postcss](https://github.com/postcss/postcss)
- Linting with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- Format with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

### Application
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)
- [React-Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
